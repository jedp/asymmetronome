# Metronome

## Features

- A useful metronome for iOS or Android
- Tap to set tempo
- Drag to change tempo
- Fancy ability to subdivide rhythm (Bartok mode: e.g., 4 + 2 + 3)

I wrote this app to help practice the six Hungarian Pieces in Bulgarian Rhythm
at the end of Book 6 of the Mikrokosmos, by Bartok:

With a standard metronome, your options are either to crank it up to 350 bpm,
which would sound maddening even if there were a metronome that went that fast,
or to turn it down to 39 and get the beat at the beginning of each measure.
That helps for making sure your overall timing is good, but it doesn't help
with getting the feel of the rhythm and the way the music plays with it.

This app lets you subdivide the rhythm into groups of beats, with stress
falling on the first of each. For this Bartok piece, you set bpm to 350 and set
the pattern to 4 + 2 + 3 + 0. 

The 0 at the end has no metrical value; it gives you something to put your
finger on and drag to increase the number of groups of beats. Dragging a value
to 0 clears out all following groups. So 4 + 0 + 3 + 3 turns into 4 + 0.

To use it as a normal metronome, just set the stress pattern to 1 + 0.
